(NLP) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where we aim to train computers to understand human languages. Some real-world applications of NLP are chatbots, Siri, and Google Translator. While working on any problem based on NLP, we should follow a process to prepare a vocabulary of words from a textual dataset. So, if you want to understand the process of solving any problem based on NLP, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through the complete process of NLP using Python.
